They started a public campaign that says , " A walking helmet is a good helmet. " 
So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking , but also for walking around . 
And you can see there they ' re shopping with their helmets . 
( Laughter ) Well yeah , I tried that . 
Now it ' s a little extreme , I admit . 
But if you think about this , this is actually -- the " Freakonomics " authors wrote about this -- that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving . 
So something to think about tonight if you ' ve had a couple . 
So I finished , and it was a success in a sense . 
All of the markers went in the right direction . 
My cholesterol went down , I lost weight , my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant . 
So that was nice . 
And it was successful overall . 
But I also learned that I was too healthy , and that was unhealthy . 
I was so focused on doing all these things that I was neglecting my friends and family . 
And as Dan Buettner can tell you , having a strong social network is so crucial to our health . 
So I finished . 
And I kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over . 
I went to the dark side , and I just indulged myself . 
It was like something out of Caligula . 
( Laughter ) Without the sex part . 
Because I have three young kids , so that wasn ' t happening . 
But the over-eating and over-drinking , definitely . 
And I finally have stabilized . 
So now I ' m back to adopting many -- not all ; I don ' t wear a helmet anymore -- but dozens of healthy behaviors that I adopted during my year . 
It was really a life-changing project . 
And I , of course , don ' t have time to go into all of them . 
Let me just tell you two really quickly . 
The first is -- and this was surprising to me ; I didn ' t expect this to come out -- but I live a much quieter life now . 
Because we live in such a noisy world . 
There ' s trains and planes and cars and Bill O ' Reilly , he ' s very noisy . 
( Laughter ) And this is a real underestimated , under-appreciated health hazard -- not just because it harms our hearing , which it obviously does , but it actually initiates the fight-or-flight response . 
A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going . 
And this , over the years , can cause real damage , cardiovascular damage . 
The World Health Organization just did a big study that they published this year . 
And it was done in Europe . 
And they estimated that 1.6 million years of healthy living are lost every year in Europe because of noise pollution . 
So they think it ' s actually very deadly . 
And by the way , it ' s also terrible for your brain . 
It really impairs cognition . 
And our Founding Fathers knew about this . 
When they wrote the Constitution , they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate . 
So without noise reduction technology , our country would not exist . 
So as a patriot , I felt it was important to -- I wear all the earplugs and the earphones , and it ' s really improved my life in a surprising and unexpected way . 
And the second point I want to make , the final point , is that -- and it ' s actually been a theme of TEDMED -- that joy is so important to your health , that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there ' s some sense of pleasure and joy in them . 
And just to give you one instance of this : food . 
The junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what ' s the most pleasurable . 
But I think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food . 
To give just one example , we love crunchiness , mouthfeel . 
So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes -- throw in some sunflower seeds . 
And you can almost trick yourself into thinking you ' re eating Doritos . 
( Laughter ) And it has made me a healthier person . 
So that is it . 
The book about it comes out in April . 
It ' s called " Drop Dead Healthy. " 
And I hope that I don ' t get sick during the book tour . 
That ' s my greatest hope . 
So thank you very much . 
When I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old , we were playing on top of a bunk bed . 
I was two years older than my sister at the time -- I mean , I ' m two years older than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do , and I wanted to play war . 
So we were up on top of our bunk beds . 
And on one side of the bunk bed , I had put out all of my G.I. Joe soldiers and weaponry . 
And on the other side were all my sister ' s My Little Ponies ready for a cavalry charge . 
There are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon , but since my sister is not here with us today , let me tell you the true story -- ( Laughter ) which is my sister ' s a little on the clumsy side . 
Somehow , without any help or push from her older brother at all , Amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor . 
I nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground . 
I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible . 
And seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy ' s arm just one week before -- ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ends ) heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet , ( Laughter ) for which I have yet to be thanked , I was trying as hard as I could -- she didn ' t even see it coming -- I was trying hard to be on my best behavior . 
And I saw my sister ' s face , this wail of pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and wake my parents from the long winter ' s nap for which they had settled . 
So I did the only thing my frantic seven year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy . 
And if you have children , you ' ve seen this hundreds of times . 
I said , " Amy , wait. Don ' t cry. Did you see how you landed ? 
No human lands on all fours like that . 
Amy , I think this means you ' re a unicorn. " 
( Laughter ) Now , that was cheating , because there was nothing she would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five year-old little sister , but Amy the special unicorn . 
Of course , this option was open to her brain at no point in the past . 
And you could see how my poor , manipulated sister faced conflict , as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced , or contemplating her new-found identity as a unicorn . 
And the latter won . 
Instead of crying or ceasing our play , instead of waking my parents , with all the negative consequences for me , a smile spread across her face and she scrambled back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn -- ( Laughter ) with one broken leg . 
What we stumbled across at this tender age of just five and seven -- we had no idea at the time -- was was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain . 
We had stumbled across something called positive psychology , which is the reason I ' m here today and the reason that I wake up every morning . 
When I started talking about this research outside of academia , with companies and schools , the first thing they said to never do is to start with a graph . 
The first thing I want to do is start with a graph . 
This graph looks boring , but it is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning . 
And this graph doesn ' t even mean anything ; it ' s fake data . 
What we found is -- ( Laughter ) If I got this data studying you , I would be thrilled , because there ' s a trend there , and that means that I can get published , which is all that really matters . 
There is one weird red dot above the curve , there ' s one weirdo in the room -- I know who you are , I saw you earlier -- that ' s no problem . 
That ' s no problem , as most of you know , because I can just delete that dot . 
I can delete that dot because that ' s clearly a measurement error . 
And we know that ' s a measurement error because it ' s messing up my data . 
( Laughter ) So one of the first things we teach people in economics , statistics , business and psychology courses is how , in a statistically valid way , do we eliminate the weirdos . 
How do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit ? 
Which is fantastic if I ' m trying to find out how many Advil the average person should be taking -- two . 
But if I ' m interested in your potential , or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity , we ' re creating the cult of the average with science . 
If I asked a question like , " How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom ? " 
scientists change the answer to " How fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom ? " 
and we tailor the class towards the average . 
If you fall below the average , then psychologists get thrilled , because that means you ' re depressed or have a disorder , or hopefully both . 
We ' re hoping for both because our business model is , if you come into a therapy session with one problem , we want to make sure you leave knowing you have ten , so you keep coming back . 
We ' ll go back into your childhood if necessary , but eventually we want to make you normal again . 
But normal is merely average .
