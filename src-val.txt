And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here . 
So the first thing you ' re going to see is the normal worm when it ' s about college student age -- a young adult . 
It ' s quite a cute little fellow . 
And next you ' re going to see the long-lived mutant when it ' s young . 
So this animal is going to live twice as long . 
Is it miserable ? It doesn ' t seem to be . 
It ' s active. You can ' t tell the difference really . 
And they can be completely fertile -- have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do . 
Now get out your handkerchiefs here . 
You ' re going to see , in just two weeks , the normal worms are old . 
You can see the little head moving down at the bottom there . 
But everything else is just lying there . 
The animal ' s clearly in the nursing home . 
And if you look at the tissues of the animal , they ' re starting to deteriorate . 
You know , even if you ' ve never seen one of these little C. elegans -- which probably most of you haven ' t seen one -- you can tell they ' re old -- isn ' t that interesting ? 
So there ' s something about aging that ' s kind of universal . 
And now here is the daf-2 mutant . 
One gene is changed out of 20,000 , and look at it . 
It ' s the same age , but it ' s not in the nursing home ; it ' s going skiing . 
This is what ' s really cool : it ' s aging more slowly . 
It takes this worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day . 
And when I tell people about this , they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person who looks really good for being 90 or 80 . 
But it ' s really more like this : let ' s say you ' re a 30 year-old guy -- or in your 30s -- and you ' re a bachelor and you ' re dating people . 
And you meet someone you really like , you get to know her . 
And you ' re in a restaurant , and you say , " Well how old are you ? " 
She says , " I ' m 60. " 
That ' s what it ' s like. And you would never know . 
You would never know , until she told you . 
( Laughter ) Okay . 
So what is the daf-2 gene ? 
Well as you know , genes , which are part of the DNA , they ' re instructions to make a protein that does something . 
And the daf-2 gene encodes a hormone receptor . 
So what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell . 
So part of it is like a baseball glove . 
Part of it ' s on the outside , and it ' s catching the hormone as it comes by in green . 
And the other part is on the inside where it sends signals into the cell . 
Okay , so what is the daf-2 receptor telling the inside of the cell ? 
I just told you that , if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell , that you get a receptor that doesn ' t work as well ; the animal lives longer . 
So that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging . 
That ' s what that arrow means . 
It speeds up aging. It makes it go faster . 
So it ' s like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself , speeding up aging . 
So this is altogether really , really interesting . 
It says that aging is subject to control by the genes , and specifically by hormones . 
So what kind of hormones are these ? 
There ' s lots of hormones. There ' s testosterone , adrenalin . 
You know about a lot of them . 
These hormones are similar to hormones that we have in our bodies . 
The daf-2 hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and IGF-1 . 
Now you ' ve all heard of at least insulin . 
Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal . 
And the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth . 
So these functions were known for these hormones for a long time , but our studies suggested that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about -- maybe they also affect aging . 
And it ' s looking like that ' s the case . 
So after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans , people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking , if we made the same daf-2 mutation , the hormone receptor mutation , in other animals , will they live longer ? 
And that is the case in flies . 
If you change this hormone pathway in flies , they live longer . 
And also in mice -- and mice are mammals like us . 
So it ' s an ancient pathway , because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution such that it still works in all these animals . 
And also , the common precursor also gave rise to people . 
So maybe it ' s working in people the same way . 
And there are hints of this . 
So for example , there was one study that was done in a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City . 
And just like any population , most of the people live to be about 70 or 80 , but some live to be 90 or 100 . 
And what they found was that people who lived to 90 or 100 were more likely to have daf-2 mutations -- that is , changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for IGF-1 . 
And these changes made the gene not act as well as the normal gene would have acted . 
It damaged the gene . 
So those are hints suggesting that humans are susceptible to the effects of the hormones for aging . 
So the next question , of course , is : Is there any effect on age-related disease ? 
As you age , you ' re much more likely to get cancer , Alzheimer ' s disease , heart disease , all sorts of diseases . 
It turns out that these long-lived mutants are more resistant to all these diseases . 
They hardly get cancer , and when they do it ' s not as severe . 
So it ' s really interesting , and it makes sense in a way , that they ' re still young , so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old ? 
So it suggests that , if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take to replicate some of these effects in humans , maybe we would have a way of combating lots of different age-related diseases all at once . 
So how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging ? 
How could that work ? 
Well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants , a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues , and repair damage . 
And the way that they ' re switched on is by a gene regulator protein called FOXO . 
So in a daf-2 mutant -- you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor . 
The receptor isn ' t working as well . 
Under those conditions , the FOXO protein in blue has gone into the nucleus -- that little compartment there in the middle of the cell -- and it ' s sitting down on a gene binding to it . 
You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO . 
And it ' s just sitting on one of them . 
So FOXO turns on a lot of genes . 
And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes , genes I call carrot-giver genes , whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well -- to fold correctly and function correctly . 
And it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell and recycle them if they ' re damaged . 
DNA repair genes are more active in these animals . 
And the immune system is more active . 
And many of these different genes , we ' ve shown , actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant . 
So it ' s really interesting . 
These animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do . 
They have the ability to protect themselves from many kinds of damage , which we think makes them live longer . 
So what about the normal worm ? 
Well when the daf-2 receptor is active , then it triggers a series of events that prevent FOXO from getting into the nucleus where the DNA is . 
So it can ' t turn the genes on . 
That ' s how it works. That ' s why we don ' t see the long lifespan , until we have the daf-2 mutant . 
But what good is this for the worm ? 
Well we think that insulin and IGF-1 hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions -- in the good times -- when food is plentiful and there ' s not a lot of stress in the environment . 
Then they promote the uptake of nutrients . 
You can store the food , use it for energy , grow , etc . 
But what we think is that , under conditions of stress , the levels of these hormones drop -- for example , having limited food supply . 
And that , we think , is registered by the animal as a danger signal , a signal that things are not okay and that it should roll out its protective capacity . 
So it activates FOXO , FOXO goes to the DNA , and that triggers the expression of these genes that improves the ability of the cell to protect itself and repair itself . 
And that ' s why we think the animals live longer . 
So you can think of FOXO as being like a building superintendent . 
So maybe he ' s a little bit lazy , but he ' s there , he ' s taking care of the building . 
But it ' s deteriorating . 
And then suddenly , he learns that there ' s going to be a hurricane . 
So he doesn ' t actually do anything himself . 
He gets on the telephone -- just like FOXO gets on the DNA -- and he calls up the roofer , the window person , the painter , the floor person . 
And they all come and they fortify the house . 
And then the hurricane comes through , and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in . 
And not only that , it can also just last longer , even if there isn ' t a hurricane . 
So that ' s the concept here for how we think this life extension ability exists . 
Now the really cool thing about FOXO is that there are different forms of it . 
We all have FOXO genes , but we don ' t all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene . 
Just like we all have eyes , but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes . 
And there are certain forms of the FOXO gene that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be 90 or 100 . 
And that ' s the case all over the world , as you can see from these stars . 
And each one of these stars represents a population where scientists have asked , " Okay , are there differences in the type of FOXO genes among people who live a really long time ? " and there are . 
We don ' t know the details of how this works , but we do know then that FOXO genes can impact the lifespan of people . 
And that means that , maybe if we tweak it a little bit , we can increase the health and longevity of people . 
So this is really exciting to me . 
A FOXO is a protein that we found in these little , round worms to affect lifespan , and here it affects lifespan in people . 
So we ' ve been trying in our lab now to develop drugs that will activate this FOXO cell using human cells now in order to try and come up with drugs that will delay aging and age-related diseases . 
And I ' m really optimistic that this is going to work . 
There are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging . 
And for at least one of them , there is a drug . 
There ' s one called TOR , which is another nutrient sensor , like the insulin pathway . 
And mutations that damage the TOR gene -- just like the daf-2 mutations -- extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice . 
But in this case , there ' s already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the TOR protein and inhibits its activity . 
And you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse -- even when it ' s pretty old , like age 60 for a human , that old for a mouse -- if you give the mouse rapamycin , it will live longer . 
Now I don ' t want you all to go out taking rapamycin . 
It is a drug for people , but the reason is it suppresses the immune system . 
So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected . 
So this may not be the perfect drug for staying young longer . 
But still , here in the year 2011 , there ' s a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age that will extend their lifespan , which comes out of this science that ' s been done in all these different animals . 
So I ' m really optimistic , and I think it won ' t be too long , I hope , before this age-old dream begins to come true . 
( Applause ) Matt Ridley : Thank you , Cynthia . 
Let me get this straight . 
Although you ' re looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed ethically , is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer ? 
CK : Ah , so the kinds of drugs I was talking about would not change the genes , they would just bind to the protein itself and change its activity . 
So if you stop taking the drug , the protein would go back to normal . 
You could change the genes in principle . 
There isn ' t the technology to do that . 
But I don ' t think that ' s a good idea . 
And the reason is that these hormones , like the insulin and the IGF hormones and the TOR pathway , they ' re essential . 
If you knock them out completely , then you ' re very sick . 
So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems . 
And I think that ' s much better , that kind of control would be much better as a drug . 
And also , there are other ways of activating FOXO that don ' t even involve insulin or IGF-1 that might even be safer . 
MR : I wasn ' t suggesting that I was going to go and do it , but ... 
( Laughter ) There ' s a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about , which is a negligible senescence . 
There are some creatures on this planet already that don ' t really do aging . 
Just move to one side for us , if you would . 
CK : There are. There are some animals that don ' t seem to age . 
For example , there are some tortoises called Blanding ' s turtles . 
And they grow to be about this size . 
And they ' ve been tagged , and they ' ve been found to be 70 years old . 
And when you look at these 70 year-old turtles , you can ' t tell the difference , just by looking , between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles . 
And the 70 year-old ones , actually they ' re better at scouting out the good nesting places , and they also have more progeny every year . 
And there are other examples of these kinds of animals , like turns , certain kinds of birds are like this . 
And nobody knows if they really can live forever , or what keeps them from aging . 
It ' s not clear . 
If you look at birds , which live a long time , cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide , things like that . 
And our long-lived mutants are too . 
They ' re more resistant to these kinds of stresses . 
So it could be that the pathways that I ' ve been talking about , which are set to run really quickly in the worm , have a different normal set point in something like a bird , so that a bird can live a lot longer . 
And maybe they ' re even set really differently in animals with no senescence at all -- but we don ' t know . 
MR : But what you ' re talking about here is not extending human lifespan by preventing death , so much as extending human youthspan . 
CK : Yes , that ' s right . 
It ' s more like , say , if you were a dog . 
You notice that you ' re getting old , and you look at your human and you think , " Why isn ' t this human getting old ? " 
They ' re not getting old in the dog ' s lifespan . 
It ' s more like that . 
But now we ' re the human looking out and imagining a different human . 
MR : Thank you very much indeed , Cynthia Kenyon . 
Let me introduce to you Rezero . 
This little fellow was developed by a group of 10 undergraduate students at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at ETH-Zurich . 
Our robot belongs to a family of robots called Ballbots . 
Instead of wheels , a Ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball . 
The main characteristics of such a system is that there ' s one sole contact point to the ground . 
This means that the robot is inherently unstable . 
It ' s like when I am trying to stand on one foot . 
You might ask yourself , what ' s the usefulness of a robot that ' s unstable ? 
Now we ' ll explain that in a second . 
Let me first explain how Rezero actually keeps his balance . 
Rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor . 
He then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately . 
This happens 160 times per second , and if anything fails in this process , Rezero would immediately fall to the ground . 
Now to move and to balance , Rezero needs to turn the ball . 
The ball is driven by three special wheels that allow Rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time . 
Due to his instability , Rezero is always in motion. Now here ' s the trick . 
It ' s indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very [ dynamically ] . 
Let ' s play a little . 
You may have wondered what happens if I give the robot a little push . 
In this mode , he ' s trying to maintain his position . 
For the next demo , I ' d like you to introduce to my colleagues Michael , on the computer , and Thomas who ' s helping me onstage . 
In the next mode , Rezero is passive , and we can move him around . 
With almost no force I can control his position and his velocity . 
I can also make him spin . 
In the next mode , we can get Rezero to follow a person . 
He ' s now keeping a constant distance to Thomas . 
This works with a laser sensor that ' s mounted on top of Rezero . 
With the same method , we can also get him to circle a person . 
We call this the orbiting mode . 
All right , thank you , Thomas . 
( Applause ) Now , what ' s the use of this technology ? 
For now , it ' s an experiment , but let me show you some possible future applications . 
Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks . 
With a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way . 
In a hospital , this device could be used to carry around medical equipment . 
Due to the Ballbot system , it has a very small footprint and it ' s also easy to move around . 
And of course , who wouldn ' t like to take a ride on one of these . 
And these are more practical applications . 
But there ' s also a certain beauty within this technology . 
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you . 
( Applause ) Thank you . 
Ladies and gentlemen , gather around . 
I would love to share with you a story . 
Once upon a time in 19th century Germany , there was the book . 
Now during this time , the book was the king of storytelling . 
It was venerable . 
It was ubiquitous . 
But it was a little bit boring . 
Because in its 400 years of existence , storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device . 
But then one author arrived , and he changed the game forever . 
( Music ) His name was Lothar , Lothar Meggendorfer . 
Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down , and he said , " Genug ist genug ! " 
He grabbed his pen , he snatched his scissors . 
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold . 
History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as -- who else ? -- the world ' s first true inventor of the children ' s pop-up book . 
( Music ) For this delight and for this wonder , people rejoiced . 
( Cheering ) They were happy because the story survived , and that the world would keep on spinning . 
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn ' t the first to evolve the way a story was told , and he certainly wasn ' t the last . 
Whether storytellers realized it or not , they were channeling Meggendorfer ' s spirit when they moved opera to vaudville , radio news to radio theater , film to film in motion to film in sound , color , 3D , on VHS and on DVD . 
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis . 
And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around . 
( Laughter ) Because , not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world , but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices . 
For example , one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine . 
One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D . 
( Laughter ) And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate . 
And after all this , everyone paused ; they took a step back . 
They realized that , in 6,000 years of storytelling , they ' ve gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls . 
And this was a cause for celebration . 
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged . 
And for the most part , the stories are recycled . 
But the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure , consistent novelty . 
And they remembered a man , one amazing German , every time a new storytelling device popped up next . 
And for that , the audience -- the lovely , beautiful audience -- would live happily ever after . 
I , like many of you , am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities . 
And there are days -- I don ' t know about the rest of you -- but there are days when I palpably feel how much I rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life . 
And some days , that can even be a little scary . 
But what I ' m here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues , if we apply open-source collaboration . 
A couple of years ago , I read an article by New York Times writer Michael Pollan , in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment . 
Now at the time that I was reading this , it was the middle of the winter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my New York City apartment . 
So I was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next Wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future . 
But that was actually exactly the point that Michael Pollan was making in this article -- it ' s precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system . 
So , I happen to know a little bit from my own work about how NASA has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space . 
And that you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high-quality liquid soil over plants ' root systems . 
Now to a vegetable plant , my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space . 
But I can offer some natural light and year-round climate control . 
Fast-forward two years later : we now have window farms , which are vertical , hydroponic platforms for food-growing indoors . 
And the way it works is that there ' s a pump at the bottom , which periodically sends this liquid nutrient solution up to the top , which then trickles down through plants ' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets -- so there ' s no dirt involved . 
Now light and temperature vary with each window ' s microclimate , so a window farm requires a farmer , and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm , and whether she is going to feed her food organically . 
Back at the time , a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing . 
And I really wanted it to be an open project , because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the United States right now , and could possibly become another area like Monsanto , where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people ' s food . 
So I decided that , instead of creating a product , what I was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of codevelopers . 
The first few systems that we created , they kind of worked . 
We were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical New York City apartment window . 
And we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers , all kinds of stuff . 
But the first few systems were these leaky , loud power-guzzlers that Martha Stewart would definitely never have approved . 
( Laughter ) So to bring on more codevelopers , what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs , we explained how they worked , and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems . 
And then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us . 
So actually now on this website , we have 18,000 people . 
And we have window farms all over the world . 
What we ' re doing is what NASA or a large corporation would call R & amp ; amp ; D , or research and development . 
But what we call it is R & amp ; amp ; D-I-Y , or " research and develop it yourself. " 
( Laughter ) So , for example , Jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps . 
It took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right , but once we did , we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half . 
Tony in Chicago has been taking on growing experiments , like lots of other window farmers , and he ' s been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low-light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients . 
And window farmers in Finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the Finnish winters by outfitting them with LED grow lights that they ' re now making open source and part of the project . 
So window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software . 
And with every open source project , the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns , and the universal concerns . 
So my core team and I are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone . 
And we ' re able to look out for the needs of newcomers . 
So for do-it-yourselfers , we provide free , very well-tested instructions so that anyone , anywhere around the world , can build one of these systems for free . 
And there ' s a patent pending on these systems as well that ' s held by the community . 
And to fund the project , we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who don ' t have time to build their own systems . 
Now within our community , a certain culture has appeared . 
In our culture , it is better to be a tester who supports someone else ' s idea than it is to be just the idea guy . 
What we get out of this project is support for our own work , as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs . 
But I think that Eleen expresses best what we really get out of this , which is the actual joy of collaboration . 
So she expresses here what it ' s like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea , built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing . 
If we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we ' re all talking about as environmentalists and food people , maybe we just need to ditch the term " consumer " and get behind the people who are doing stuff . 
Open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own . 
And what we ' re seeing is that R & amp ; amp ; D-I-Y has moved beyond just window farms and LEDs into solar panels and aquaponic systems . 
And we ' re building upon innovations of generations who went before us . 
And we ' re looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now . 
So we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united , and to declare that we are all still pioneers . 
Meet Tony. He ' s my student . 
He ' s about my age , and he ' s in San Quentin State Prison . 
When Tony was 16 years old , one day , one moment , " It was mom ' s gun . 
Just flash it , scare the guy. He ' s a punk . 
He took some money ; we ' ll take his money. That ' ll teach him . 
Then last minute , I ' m thinking , ' Can ' t do this. This is wrong. ' My buddy says , ' C ' mon , let ' s do this. ' I say , ' Let ' s do this. ' " And those three words , Tony ' s going to remember , because the next thing he knows , he hears the pop . 
There ' s the punk on the ground , puddle of blood . 
And that ' s felony murder -- 25 to life , parole at 50 if you ' re lucky , and Tony ' s not feeling very lucky . 
So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison and I say , " In this class , we will discuss the foundations of ethics , " Tony interrupts me . 
" What are you going to teach me about right and wrong ? 
I know what is wrong. I have done wrong . 
I am told every day , by every face I see , every wall I face , that I am wrong . 
If I ever get out of here , there will always be a mark by my name . 
I ' m a convict ; I am branded ' wrong. ' What are you going to tell me about right and wrong ? " 
So I say to Tony , " Sorry , but it ' s worse than you think . 
You think you know right and wrong ? 
Then can you tell me what wrong is ? 
No , don ' t just give me an example . 
I want to know about wrongness itself , the idea of wrong . 
What is that idea ? 
What makes something wrong ? 
How do we know that it ' s wrong ? Maybe you and I disagree . 
Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong . 
Maybe it ' s you , maybe it ' s me -- but we ' re not here to trade opinions ; everyone ' s got an opinion . 
We are here for knowledge . 
Our enemy is thoughtlessness. This is philosophy. " 
And something changes for Tony . 
" Could be I ' m wrong. I ' m tired of being wrong . 
I want to know what is wrong . 
I want to know what I know. " 
What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy , the project that begins in wonder -- what Kant called " admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within. " 
What can creatures like us know of such things ? 
It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence -- what Heidegger called " the always already there. " 
It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it -- what Socrates called " the examined life. " 
Socrates , a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing . 
Socrates died in prison , his philosophy intact . 
So Tony starts doing his homework . 
He learns his whys and wherefores , his causes and correlations , his logic , his fallacies . 
Turns out , Tony ' s got the philosophy muscle . 
His body is in prison , but his mind is free . 
Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous , the epistemologically anxious , the ethically dubious , the metaphysically ridiculous . 
That ' s Plato , Descartes , Nietzsche and Bill Clinton . 
So when he gives me his final paper , in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure , I say , " I don ' t know . 
Let us think about that. " 
Because in that moment , there ' s no mark by Tony ' s name ; it ' s just the two of us standing there . 
It is not professor and convict , it is just two minds ready to do philosophy . 
And I say to Tony , " Let ' s do this. " 
In 1994 , I walked into a prison in Cambodia , and I met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel . 
And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners , that I would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 12-year-old boy who had done something important for anybody . 
He was not a political prisoner . 
He was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle . 
What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia , but of the 113 developing countries that torture , 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured . 
And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool . 
We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners . 
It is for people who are in broken-down legal systems , and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation -- it ' s cheaper than having a legal system , cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel -- it is what happens most of the time . 
I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decision , to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime , but it will require three things . 
First is the training , empowerment , and connection of defenders worldwide . 
The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel . 
And the third is commitment . 
So in the year 2000 , I began to wonder , what if we came together ? 
Could we do something for these 93 countries ? 
And I founded International Bridges to Justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms . 
My first experiences , though , did come from Cambodia , and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were , in 1994 , still less than 10 attorneys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all . 
And even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so consequently you ' d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys , you ' d meet women and you ' d say , " Why are you here ? " Women would say , " Well I ' ve been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they can ' t find him. " 
So it ' s just a place where there was no rule of law . 
The first group of defenders came together and I still remember , as I was training , I said , " Okay , what do you do for an investigation ? " 
And there was silence in the class , and finally one woman stood up , [ inaudible name ] , and she said " Khrew , " which means " teacher. " 
She said , " I have defended more than a hundred people , and I ' ve never had to do any investigation , because they all come with confessions. " 
And we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the confessions might not be reliable , but number two , we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law . 
And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws . 
And I still remember the first cases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would support her , and the judges kept saying , " No , no , no , no , we ' re going to do things the exact same way we ' ve been doing them. " 
But one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house . 
She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her . 
She was pregnant at the time. She had cigarette burns on her. She ' d miscarried . 
And when they brought her case to the judge , for the first time he stood up and he said , " Yes , there ' s no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released. " 
And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia . 
But Cambodia is not alone . 
I used to think , well is it Cambodia ? 
Or is it other countries ? 
But it is in so many countries . 
In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn ' t a 12-year-old boy , it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone . 
Or a woman , I picked up her baby , really cute baby , I said " Your baby is so cute. " 
It wasn ' t a baby , she was three . 
And she said " Yeah , but she ' s why I ' m here , " because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison . 
And when I walked up to the prison director , I said , " You ' ve got to let her out . 
A judge would let her out. " 
And he said , " Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison. Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer. What can we do ? " 
So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases . 
But we realized that it ' s not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference . 
For example , in Cambodia , it was that [ inaudible name ] did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together. And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , " It ' s like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together. " 
Or in Zimbabwe , where I remember Innocent , after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said , " I ' ve been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a lawyer , " he came and we had a training together and he said , " I have heard it said " -- because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling -- " I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources. " 
And then he said , " But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice. " 
And with that , he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases . 
The key that we see , though , is training and then early access . 
I was recently in Egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , " Hey , look , we don ' t have police on the streets now. The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution. They were torturing everybody all the time. " 
And I said , " But there ' s been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here . 
What ' s going on ? " 
I met with one of the development agencies , and they were training prosecutors and judges , which is the normal bias , as opposed to defenders . 
And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual . 
I said , " I ' m gonna copy this. " 
It had everything in it. Lawyers can come at the police station. It was perfect . 
Prosecutors were perfectly trained . 
But I said to them , " I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor ' s office , what had happened to them ? " 
And after a pause , they said , " They had been tortured. " 
So the pieces are , not only the training of the lawyers , but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel , because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured . 
And as I tell you this , I ' m also aware of the fact that it sounds like , " Oh , okay , it sounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? " 
Because it sounds big . 
And there are many reasons why I believe it ' s possible . 
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment . 
It ' s not only Innocent , who I told you about in Zimbabwe , but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces . 
We have a program called JusticeMakers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ? 
So it ' s an online contest where it ' s only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice . 
And there are 30 JusticeMakers throughout the world , from Sri Lanka to Swaziland to the DRC , who with five thousand dollars do amazing things , through SMS programs , through paralegal programs , through whatever they can do . 
And it ' s not only these JusticeMakers , but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward . 
So in China , for instance , great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished . 
And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers , and said , " How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is implemented ? 
This is fantastic. " And he said to me , " Well , do you have money ? " And I said , " No. " And he said , " That ' s okay , we can still figure it out. " 
And on December 4 , he organized three thousand members of the Youth Communist League , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed posters with the new laws , and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights . 
So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders . 
We need to systematically implement early access to counsel . 
But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this . 
And people often say to me , " You know , this is great , but it ' s wildly idealistic . 
Never going to happen. " 
And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end apartheid . 
It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit . 
Now , there ' s one of our favorite poems from the defenders , which they share from each other , is : " Take courage friends , the road is often long , the path is never clear , and the stakes are very high , but deep down , you are not alone. " 
And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end torture as an investigative tool . 
I end always , because I ' m sure the questions are -- and I ' d be happy to talk to you at any point -- " But what can I really do ? " 
Well , I would say this. First of all , you know what you can do. But second of all , I would leave you with the story of Vishna , who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bridges to Justice . 
Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province. But because he was born in the prison , everybody loved him , including the guards , so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars . 
So , you know , there ' s bars. And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? Your head gets bigger . 
So he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first. And he would grab my pinkie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit . 
You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners. And I would lift him , and he would put his fingers through . 
Or if they were dark cells , it was like iron corrugated , and he would put his fingers through . 
And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine , and they looked forward to him. And I was like , here ' s Vishna. He ' s a 4-year-old boy . 
He was born in a prison with almost nothing , no material goods , but he had a sense of his own heroic journey , which I believe we are all born into. He said , " Probably I can ' t do everything . 
But I ' m one. I can do something . 
And I will do the one thing that I can do. " 
So I thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us . 
Okay , I have no idea what we ' re going to play . 
I won ' t be able to tell you what it is until it happens . 
I didn ' t realize there was going to be a little music before . 
So I think I ' m going to start with what I just heard . 
( Music ) ( Applause ) Okay , so first of all , let ' s welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums , ( Applause ) Burniss Travis on the bass , ( Applause ) and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano . 
( Applause ) So the bandstand , as we call it , this is an incredible space . 
It is really a sacred space . 
And one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past . 
You really are alive right here in this moment . 
There are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand . 
We had no idea what key we were going to play in . 
In the middle , we sort of made our way into a song called " Titi Boom. " 
But that could have happened -- maybe , maybe not . 
Everyone ' s listening. We ' re responding . 
You have no time for projected ideas . 
So the idea of a mistake : From the perspective of a jazz musician , it ' s easier to talk about someone else ' s mistake . 
So the way I perceive a mistake when I ' m on the bandstand -- first of all , we don ' t really see it as a mistake . 
The only mistake lies in that I ' m not able to perceive what it is that someone else did . 
Every " mistake " is an opportunity in jazz . 
So it ' s hard to even describe what a funny note would be . 
So for example , if I played a color , like we were playing on a palette , that sounded like this ... 
( Music ) So if Christian played a note -- like play an F . 
( Music ) See , these are all right inside of the color palette . 
If you played an E . 
See , these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting . 
If you played an F # though , ( Dissonance ) to most people ' s ears , they would perceive that as a mistake . 
So I ' m going to show you , we ' re going to play just for a second . 
And we ' re going to play on this palette . 
And at some point , Christian will introduce this note . 
And we won ' t react to it . 
He ' ll introduce it for a second and then I ' ll stop , I ' ll talk for a second . 
We ' ll see what happens when we play with this palette . 
( Music ) So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake . 
The only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn ' t react to it . 
It was an opportunity that was missed . 
So it ' s unpredictable. We ' ll paint this palette again . 
He ' ll play it. I don ' t know how we ' ll react to it , but something will change . 
We ' ll all accept his ideas , or not . 
( Music ) So you see , he played this note . 
I ended up creating a melody out of it . 
The texture changed in the drums this time . 
It got a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it . 
So there is no mistake . 
The only mistake is if I ' m not aware , if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his fellow band member to incorporate the idea and we don ' t allow for creativity . 
So jazz , this bandstand is absolutely amazing . 
It ' s a very purifying experience . 
And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don ' t take it for granted . 
We know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing . 
So how does this all relate to behavioral finance ? 
Well we ' re jazz musicians , so stereotypically we don ' t have a great relationship to finance . 
( Laughter ) Anyway , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it . 
And the other dynamic of it is that we don ' t micromanage in jazz . 
You have some people who do . 
But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities . 
If I come up and I dictate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just jump right in ... 
ready , just play some time . 
One , two , one , two , three , four . 
( Music ) It ' s kind of chaotic because I ' m bullying my ideas . 
I ' m telling them , " You come with me over this way. " 
If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen . 
This is a science of listening . 
It has far more to do with what I can perceive than what it is that I can do . 
So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity , the first step for me is to be patient , to listen to what ' s going on and pull from something that ' s going on around me . 
When you do that , you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more , and gradually it builds . 
Watch. One , two , a one , two , three , four . 
( Music ) Totally different experience when I ' m pulling ideas . 
It ' s much more organic. It ' s much more nuanced . 
It ' s not about bullying my vision or anything like that . 
It ' s about being here in the moment , accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow . 
My travels to Afghanistan began many , many years ago on the eastern border of my country , my homeland , Poland . 
I was walking through the forests of my grandmother ' s tales . 
A land where every field hides a grave , where millions of people have been deported or killed in the 20th century . 
Behind the destruction , I found a soul of places . 
I met humble people . 
I heard their prayer and ate their bread . 
Then I have been walking East for 20 years -- from Eastern Europe to Central Asia -- through the Caucasus Mountains , Middle East , North Africa , Russia . 
And I ever met more humble people . 
And I shared their bread and their prayer . 
This is why I went to Afghanistan . 
One day , I crossed the bridge over the Oxus River . 
I was alone on foot . 
And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport . 
But he gave me a cup of tea . 
And I understood that his surprise was my protection . 
So I have been walking and traveling , by horses , by yak , by truck , by hitchhiking , from Iran ' s border to the bottom , to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor . 
And in this way I could find noor , the hidden light of Afghanistan . 
My only weapon was my notebook and my Leica . 
I heard prayers of the Sufi -- humble Muslims , hated by the Taliban . 
Hidden river , interconnected with the mysticism from Gibraltar to India . 
The mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears , and welcomed as a gift . 
What do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect , about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium ? 
These are opium-addicted people on the roofs of Kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war . 
These are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen . 
What do we know about the women 10 years after the war ? 
Clothed in this nylon bag , made in China , with the name of burqa . 
I saw one day , the largest school in Afghanistan , a girls ' school . 
13,000 girls studying here in the rooms underground , full of scorpions . 
And their love [ for studying ] was so big that I cried . 
What do we know about the death threats by the Taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh ? 
The region is not secure , but full of the Taliban , and they did it . 
My aim is to give a voice to the silent people , to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game , the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict . 
I ' m here to talk about the wonder and the mystery of conscious minds . 
The wonder is about the fact that we all woke up this morning and we had with it the amazing return of our conscious mind . 
We recovered minds with a complete sense of self and a complete sense of our own existence , yet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder . 
We should , in fact , because without having this possibility of conscious minds , we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our humanity ; we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world . 
We would have no pains , but also no joys . 
We would have no access to love or to the ability to create . 
And of course , Scott Fitzgerald said famously that " he who invented consciousness would have a lot to be blamed for. " 
But he also forgot that without consciousness , he would have no access to true happiness and even the possibility of transcendence . 
So much for the wonder , now for the mystery . 
This is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to elucidate . 
All the way back into early philosophy and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience , this has been one mystery that has always resisted elucidation , has got major controversies . 
And there are actually many people that think we should not even touch it ; we should just leave it alone , it ' s not to be solved . 
I don ' t believe that , and I think the situation is changing . 
It would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make consciousness in our brains , but we certainly can begin to approach the question , and we can begin to see the shape of a solution . 
And one more wonder to celebrate is the fact that we have imaging technologies that now allow us to go inside the human brain and be able to do , for example , what you ' re seeing right now . 
These are images that come from Hanna Damasio ' s lab , and which show you , in a living brain , the reconstruction of that brain . 
And this is a person who is alive . 
This is not a person that is being studied at autopsy . 
And even more -- and this is something that one can be really amazed about -- is what I ' m going to show you next , which is going underneath the surface of the brain and actually looking in the living brain at real connections , real pathways . 
So all of those colored lines correspond to bunches of axons , the fibers that join cell bodies to synapses . 
And I ' m sorry to disappoint you , they don ' t come in color . 
But at any rate , they are there . 
The colors are codes for the direction , from whether it is back to front or vice versa . 
At any rate , what is consciousness ? 
What is a conscious mind ? 
And we could take a very simple view and say , well , it is that which we lose when we fall into deep sleep without dreams , or when we go under anesthesia , and it is what we regain when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia . 
But what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia , or when we are in deep , dreamless sleep ? 
Well first of all , it is a mind , which is a flow of mental images . 
And of course consider images that can be sensory patterns , visual , such as you ' re having right now in relation to the stage and me , or auditory images , as you are having now in relation to my words . 
That flow of mental images is mind . 
But there is something else that we are all experiencing in this room . 
We are not passive exhibitors of visual or auditory or tactile images . 
We have selves . 
We have a Me that is automatically present in our minds right now . 
We own our minds . 
And we have a sense that it ' s everyone of us that is experiencing this -- not the person who is sitting next to you . 
So in order to have a conscious mind , you have a self within the conscious mind . 
So a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it . 
The self introduces the subjective perspective in the mind , and we are only fully conscious when self comes to mind . 
So what we need to know to even address this mystery is , number one , how are minds are put together in the brain , and , number two , how selves are constructed . 
Now the first part , the first problem , is relatively easy -- it ' s not easy at all -- but it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience . 
And it ' s quite clear that , in order to make minds , we need to construct neural maps . 
So imagine a grid , like the one I ' m showing you right now , and now imagine , within that grid , that two-dimensional sheet , imagine neurons . 
And picture , if you will , a billboard , a digital billboard , where you have elements that can be either lit or not . 
And depending on how you create the pattern of lighting or not lighting , the digital elements , or , for that matter , the neurons in the sheet , you ' re going to be able to construct a map . 
This , of course , is a visual map that I ' m showing you , but this applies to any kind of map -- auditory , for example , in relation to sound frequencies , or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate . 
Now to bring home the point of how close it is -- the relationship between the grid of neurons and the topographical arrangement of the activity of the neurons and our mental experience -- I ' m going to tell you a personal story . 
So if I cover my left eye -- I ' m talking about me personally , not all of you -- if I cover my left eye , I look at the grid -- pretty much like the one I ' m showing you . 
Everything is nice and fine and perpendicular . 
But sometime ago , I discovered that if I cover my left eye , instead what I get is this . 
I look at the grid and I see a warping at the edge of my central-left field . 
Very odd -- I ' ve analyzed this for a while . 
But sometime ago , through the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine , Carmen Puliafito , who developed a laser scanner of the retina , I found out the the following . 
If I scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner , what I get is the following . 
On the right side , my retina is perfectly symmetrical . 
You see the going down towards the fovea where the optic nerve begins . 
But on my left retina there is a bump , which is marked there by the red arrow . 
And it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below . 
And that is exactly what causes the warping of my visual image . 
So just think of this : you have a grid of neurons , and now you have a plane mechanical change in the position of the grid , and you get a warping of your mental experience . 
So this is how close your mental experience and the activity of the neurons in the retina , which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball , or , for that matter , a sheet of visual cortex . 
So from the retina you go onto visual cortex . 
And of course , the brain adds on a lot of information to what is going on in the signals that come from the retina . 
And in that image there , you see a variety of islands of what I call image-making regions in the brain . 
You have the green for example , that corresponds to tactile information , or the blue that corresponds to auditory information . 
And something else that happens is that those image-making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural maps , can then provide signals to this ocean of purple that you see around , which is the association cortex , where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image-making . 
And the great beauty is that you can then go from memory , out of those association cortices , and produce back images in the very same regions that have perception . 
So think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy the brain is . 
So it provides certain areas for perception and image-making . 
And those are exactly the same that are going to be used for image-making when we recall information . 
So far the mystery of the conscious mind is diminishing a little bit because we have a general sense of how we make these images . 
But what about the self ? 
The self is really the elusive problem . 
And for a long time , people did not even want to touch it , because they ' d say , " How can you have this reference point , this stability , that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day ? " 
And I thought about a solution to this problem . 
We generate brain maps of the body ' s interior and use them as the reference for all other maps . 
So let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this . 
I came to this because , if you ' re going to have a reference that we know as self -- the Me , the I in our own processing -- we need to have something that is stable , something that does not deviate much from day to day . 
Well it so happens that we have a singular body . 
We have one body , not two , not three . 
And so that is a beginning . 
There is just one reference point , which is the body . 
But then , of course , the body has many parts , and things grow at different rates , and they have different sizes and different people ; however , not so with the interior . 
The things that have to do with what is known as our internal milieu -- for example , the whole management of the chemistries within our body are , in fact , extremely maintained day after day for one very good reason . 
If you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that life-permitting survival range , you go into disease or death . 
So we have an in-built system within our own lives that ensures some kind of continuity . 
I like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day . 
Because if you don ' t have that sameness , physiologically , you ' re going to be sick or you ' re going to die . 
So that ' s one more element for this continuity . 
And the final thing is that there is a very tight coupling between the regulation of our body within the brain and the body itself , unlike any other coupling . 
So for example , I ' m making images of you , but there ' s no physiological bond between the images I have of you as an audience and my brain . 
However , there is a close , permanently maintained bond between the body regulating parts of my brain and my own body . 
So here ' s how it looks. Look at the region there . 
There is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord . 
And it is within that region that I ' m going to highlight now that we have this housing of all the life-regulation devices of the body . 
This is so specific that , for example , if you look at the part that is covered in red in the upper part of the brain stem , if you damage that as a result of a stroke , for example , what you get is coma or vegetative state , which is a state , of course , in which your mind disappears , your consciousness disappears . 
What happens then actually is that you lose the grounding of the self , you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence , and , in fact , there can be images going on , being formed in the cerebral cortex , except you don ' t know they ' re there . 
You have , in effect , lost consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem . 
But if you consider the green part of the brain stem , nothing like that happens . 
It is that specific . 
So in that green component of the brain stem , if you damage it , and often it happens , what you get is complete paralysis , but your conscious mind is maintained . 
You feel , you know , you have a fully conscious mind that you can report very indirectly . 
This is a horrific condition. You don ' t want to see it . 
And people are , in fact , imprisoned within their own bodies , but they do have a mind . 
There was a very interesting film , one of the rare good films done about a situation like this , by Julian Schnabel some years ago about a patient that was in that condition . 
So now I ' m going to show you a picture . 
I promise not to say anything about this , except this is to frighten you . 
It ' s just to tell you that in that red section of the brain stem , there are , to make it simple , all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make brain maps of different aspects of our interior , different aspects of our body . 
They are exquisitely topographic and they are exquisitely interconnected in a recursive pattern . 
And it is out of this and out of this tight coupling between the brain stem and the body that I believe -- and I could be wrong , but I don ' t think I am -- that you generate this mapping of the body that provides the grounding for the self and that comes in the form of feelings -- primordial feelings , by the way . 
So what is the picture that we get here ? 
Look at " cerebral cortex , " look at " brain stem , " look at " body , " and you get the picture of the interconnectivity in which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self in a very tight interconnection with the body . 
And you have the cerebral cortex providing the great spectacle of our minds with the profusion of images that are , in fact , the contents of our minds and that we normally pay most attention to , as we should , because that ' s really the film that is rolling in our minds . 
They ' re not there for looks . 
They ' re there because there ' s this very close interaction . 
You cannot have a conscious mind if you don ' t have the interaction between cerebral cortex and brain stem . 
You cannot have a conscious mind if you don ' t have the interaction between the brain stem and the body . 
Another thing that is interesting is that the brain stem that we have is shared with a variety of other species . 
So throughout vertebrates , the design of the brain stem is very similar to ours , which is one of the reasons why I think those other species have conscious minds like we do . 
Except that they ' re not as rich as ours , because they don ' t have a cerebral cortex like we do . 
And I strongly disagree with the idea that consciousness should be considered as the great product of the cerebral cortex . 
Only the wealth of our minds is , not the very fact that we have a self that we can refer to our own existence , and that we have any sense of person . 
Now there are three levels of self to consider -- the proto , the core and the autobiographical . 
The first two are shared with many , many other species , and they are really coming out largely of the brain stem and whatever there is of cortex in those species . 
It ' s the autobiographical self which some species have , I think . 
Cetaceans and primates have also an autobiographical self to a certain degree . 
And everybody ' s dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree . 
But the novelty is here . 
The autobiographical self is built on the basis of past memories and memories of the plans that we have made ; it ' s the lived past and the anticipated future . 
And the autobiographical self has prompted extended memory , reasoning , imagination , creativity and language . 
And out of that came the instruments of culture -- religions , justice , trade , the arts , science , technology . 
And it is within that culture that we really can get -- and this is the novelty -- something that is not entirely set by our biology . 
It is developed in the cultures . 
It developed in collectives of human beings . 
And this is , of course , the culture where we have developed something that I like to call socio-cultural regulation . 
And finally , you could rightly ask , why care about this ? 
Why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex and how this is made ? 
Three reasons. First , curiosity . 
Primates are extremely curious -- and humans most of all . 
And if we are interested , for example , in the fact that anti-gravity is pulling galaxies away from the Earth , why should we not be interested in what is going on inside of human beings ? 
Second , understanding society and culture . 
We should look at how society and culture in this socio-cultural regulation are a work in progress . 
And finally , medicine . 
Let ' s not forget that some of the worst diseases of humankind are diseases such as depression , Alzheimer ' s disease , drug addiction . 
Think of strokes that can devastate your mind or render you unconscious . 
You have no prayer of treating those diseases effectively and in a non-serendipitous way if you do not know how this works . 
So that ' s a very good reason beyond curiosity to justify what we ' re doing , and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains . 
( Applause ) 
Do you remember the story of Odysseus and the Sirens from high school or junior high school ? 
There was this hero , Odysseus , who ' s heading back home after the Trojan War . 
And he ' s standing on the deck of his ship , he ' s talking to his first mate , and he ' s saying , " Tomorrow , we will sail past those rocks , and on those rocks sit some beautiful women called Sirens . 
And these women sing an enchanting song , a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die. " 
Now you would expect , given that , that they would choose an alternate route around the Sirens , but instead Odysseus says , " I want to hear that song . 
And so what I ' m going to do is I ' m going to pour wax in the ears of you and all the men -- stay with me -- so that you can ' t hear the song , and then I ' m going to have you tie me to the mast so that I can listen and we can all sail by unaffected. " 
So this is a captain putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk so that he can hear a song . 
And I ' d like to think if this was the case , they probably would have rehearsed it a few times . 
Odysseus would have said , " Okay , let ' s do a dry run . 
You tie me to the mast , and I ' m going to beg and plead . 
And no matter what I say , you cannot untie me from the mast . 
All right , so tie me to the mast. " 
And the first mate takes a rope and ties Odysseus to the mast in a nice knot . 
And Odysseus does his best job playacting and says , " Untie me. Untie me . 
I want to hear that song. Untie me. " 
And the first mate wisely resists and doesn ' t untie Odysseus . 
And then Odysseus says , " I see that you can get it . 
All right , untie me now and we ' ll get some dinner. " 
And the first mate hesitates . 
He ' s like , " Is this still the rehearsal , or should I untie him ? " 
And the first mate thinks , " Well , I guess at some point the rehearsal has to end. " 
So he unties Odysseus , and Odysseus flips out . 
He ' s like , " You idiot. You moron . 
If you do that tomorrow , I ' ll be dead , you ' ll be dead , every single one of the men will be dead . 
Now just don ' t untie me no matter what. " 
He throws the first mate to the ground . 
This repeats itself through the night -- rehearsal , tying to the mast , conning his way out of it , beating the poor first mate up mercilessly . 
Hilarity ensues . 
Tying yourself to a mast is perhaps the oldest written example of what psychologists call a commitment device . 
A commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you don ' t do something regrettable when you have a hot head . 
Because there ' s two heads inside one person when you think about it . 
Scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temptation . 
There is first , the present self . 
This is like Odysseus when he ' s hearing the song . 
He just wants to get to the front row . 
He just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification . 
But then there ' s this other self , the future self . 
This is Odysseus as an old man who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa with his wife Penelope outside of Ithaca -- the other one . 
So why do we need commitment devices ? 
Well resisting temptation is hard , as the 19th century English economist Nassau William Senior said , " To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power , or to seek distant rather than immediate results , are among the most painful exertions of the human will. " 
If you set goals for yourself and you ' re like a lot of other people , you probably realize it ' s not that your goals are physically impossible that ' s keeping you from achieving them , it ' s that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them . 
It ' s physically possible to lose weight . 
It ' s physically possible to exercise more . 
But resisting temptation is hard . 
The other reason that it ' s difficult to resist temptation is because it ' s an unequal battle between the present self and the future self . 
I mean , let ' s face it , the present self is present . 
It ' s in control. It ' s in power right now . 
It has these strong , heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth . 
And the future self is not even around . 
It ' s off in the future. It ' s weak . 
It doesn ' t even have a lawyer present . 
There ' s nobody to stick up for the future self . 
And so the present self can trounce all over its dreams . 
So there ' s this battle between the two selves that ' s being fought , and we need commitment devices to level the playing field between the two . 
Now I ' m a big fan of commitment devices actually . 
Tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one , but there are other ones such as locking a credit card away with a key or not bringing junk food into the house so you won ' t eat it or unplugging your Internet connection so you can use your computer . 
I was creating commitment devices of my own long before I knew what they were . 
So when I was a starving post-doc at Columbia University , I was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career . 
I had to write five pages a day towards papers or I would have to give up five dollars . 
And when you try to execute these commitment devices , you realize the devil is really in the details . 
Because it ' s not that easy to get rid of five dollars . 
I mean , you can ' t burn it ; that ' s illegal . 
And I thought , well I could give it to a charity or give it to my wife or something like that . 
But then I thought , oh , I ' m sending myself mixed messages . 
Because not writing is bad , but giving to charity is good . 
So then I would kind of justify not writing by giving a gift . 
And then I kind of flipped that around and thought , well I could give it to the neo-Nazis . 
But then I was like , that ' s more bad than writing is good , and so that wouldn ' t work . 
So ultimately , I just decided I would leave it in an envelope on the subway . 
Sometimes a good person would find it , sometimes a bad person would find it . 
On average , it was just a completely pointless exchange of money that I would regret . 
( Laughter ) Such it is with commitment devices . 
But despite my like for them , there ' s two nagging concerns that I ' ve always had about commitment devices , and you might feel this if you use them yourself . 
So the first is , when you ' ve got one of these devices going , such as this contract to write everyday or pay , it ' s just a constant reminder that you have no self-control . 
You ' re just telling yourself , " Without you , commitment device , I am nothing , I have no self-discipline. " 
And then when you ' re ever in a situation where you don ' t have a commitment device in place -- like , " Oh my God , that person ' s offering me a doughnut , and I have no defense mechanism , " -- you just eat it . 
So I don ' t like the way that they take the power away from you . 
I think self-discipline is something , it ' s like a muscle . 
The more you exercise it , the stronger it gets . 
The other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them . 
You say , " Well , of course I can ' t write today , because I ' m giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews , and then I ' m going to a cocktail party and then I ' ll be drunk after that . 
And so there ' s no way that this is going to work. " 
So in effect , you are like Odysseus and the first mate in one person . 
You ' re putting yourself , you ' re binding yourself , and you ' re weaseling your way out of it , and then you ' re beating yourself up afterwards . 
So I ' ve been working for about a decade now on finding other ways to change people ' s relationship to the future self without using commitment devices . 
In particular , I ' m interested in the relationship to the future financial self . 
And this is a timely issue . 
I ' m talking about the topic of saving . 
Now saving is a classic two selves problem . 
The present self does not want to save at all . 
It wants to consume . 
Whereas the future self wants the present self to save . 
So this is a timely problem . 
We look at the savings rate and it has been declining since the 1950s . 
At the same time , the Retirement Risk Index , the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement , has been increasing . 
And we ' re at a situation now where for every three baby boomers , the McKinsey Global Institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs while they ' re in retirement . 
So what can we do about this ? 
There ' s a philosopher , Derek Parfit , who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I . 
He said that , " We might neglect our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination. " 
That is to say , we somehow might not believe that we ' re going to get old , or we might not be able to imagine that we ' re going to get old some day . 
On the one hand , it sounds ridiculous . 
Of course , we know that we ' re going to get old . 
But aren ' t there things that we believe and don ' t believe at the same time ? 
So my coauthors and I have used computers , the greatest tool of our time , to assist people ' s imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future . 
And I ' ll show you some of these tools right here . 
The first is called the distribution builder . 
It shows people what the future might be like by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes that might be obtained in the future . 
Each outcome is shown by one of these markers , and each sits on a row that represents a level of wealth and retirement . 
Being up at the top means that you ' re enjoying a high income in retirement . 
Being down at the bottom means that you ' re struggling to make ends meet . 
When you make an investment , what you ' re really saying is , " I accept that any one of these 100 things could happen to me and determine my wealth. " 
Now you can try to move your outcomes around . 
You can try to manipulate your fate , like this person is doing , but it costs you something to do it . 
It means that you have to save more today . 
Once you find an investment that you ' re happy with , what people do is they click " done " and the markers begin to disappear , slowly , one by one . 
It simulates what it is like to invest in something and to watch that investment pan out . 
At the end , there will only be one marker left standing and it will determine our wealth in retirement . 
Yes , this person retired at 150 percent of their working income in retirement . 
They ' re making more money while retired than they were making while they were working . 
If you ' re like most people , just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy -- just to think about making 50 percent more money in retirement than before . 
However , had you ended up on the very bottom , it might have given you a slight sense of dread and/or nausea thinking about struggling to get by in retirement . 
By using this tool over and over and simulating outcome after outcome , people can understand that the investments and savings that they undertake today determine their well-being in the future . 
Now people are motivated through emotions , but different people find different things motivating . 
This is a simulation that uses graphics , but other people find motivating what money can buy , not just numbers . 
So here I made a distribution builder where instead of showing numerical outcomes , I show people what those outcomes will get you , in particular apartments that you can afford if you ' re retiring on 3,000 , 2,500 , 2,000 dollars per month and so on . 
As you move down the ladder of apartments , you see that they get worse and worse . 
Some of them look like places I lived in as a graduate student . 
And as you get to the very bottom , you ' re faced with the unfortunate reality that if you don ' t save anything for retirement , you won ' t be able to afford any housing at all . 
Those are actual pictures of actual apartments renting for that amount as advertised on the Internet . 
The last thing I ' ll show you , the last behavioral time machine , is something that I created with Hal Hershfield , who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project , Bill Sharpe . 
And what it is is an exploration into virtual reality . 
So what we do is we take pictures of people -- in this case , college-age people -- and we use software to age them and show these people what they ' ll look like when they ' re 60 , 70 , 80 years old . 
And we try to test whether actually assisting your imagination by looking at the face of your future self can change you investment behavior . 
So this is one of our experiments . 
Here we see the face of the young subject on the left . 
He ' s given a control that allows him to adjust his savings rate . 
As he moves his savings rate down , it means that he ' s saving zero when it ' s all the way here at the left . 
You can see his current annual income -- this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today -- is quite high , 91 percent , but his retirement income is quite low . 
He ' s going to retire on 44 percent of what he earned while he was working . 
If he saves the maximum legal amount , his retirement income goes up , but he ' s unhappy because now he has less money on the left-hand side to spend today . 
Other conditions show people the future self . 
And from the future self ' s point of view , everything is in reverse . 
If you save very little , the future self is unhappy living on 44 percent of the income . 
Whereas if the present self saves a lot , the future self is delighted , where the income is close up near 100 percent . 
To bring this to a wider audience , I ' ve been working with Hal and Allianz to create something we call the behavioral time machine , in which you not only get to see yourself in the future , but you get to see anticipated emotional reactions to different levels of retirement wealth . 
So for instance , here is somebody using the tool . 
And just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider . 
The younger face gets happier and happier , saving nothing . 
The older face is miserable . 
And slowly , slowly we ' re bringing it up to a moderate savings rate . 
And then it ' s a high savings rate . 
The younger face is getting unhappy . 
The older face is quite pleased with the decision . 
We ' re going to see if this has an effect on what people do . 
And what ' s nice about it is it ' s not something that biasing people actually , because as one face smiles , the other face frowns . 
It ' s not telling you which way to put the slider , it ' s just reminding you that you are connected to and legally tied to this future self . 
Your decisions today are going to determine its well-being . 
And that ' s something that ' s easy to forget . 
This use of virtual reality is not just good for making people look older . 
There are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke , if they get too much exposure to the sun , if they gain weight and so on . 
And what ' s good is , unlike in the experiments that Hal and myself ran with Russ Smith , you don ' t have to program these by yourself in order to see the virtual reality . 
There are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing . 
This is actually a picture of Hal , my coauthor . 
You might recognize him from the previous demos . 
And just for kicks we ran his picture through the balding , aging and weight gain software to see how he would look . 
Hal is here , so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image . 
And I ' ll close it there . 
On behalf of Hal and myself , I wish all the best to your present and future selves . 
I ' ve spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good cause , which is self-improvement . 
And I ' ve done this in three parts . 
So first I started with the mind . 
And I decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z -- or , more precisely , from " a-ak " to " Zywiec. " 
And here ' s a little image of that . 
And this was an amazing year . 
It was really a fascinating journey . 
It was painful at times , especially for those around me . 
My wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation . 
So it had its downsides . 
But after that , I decided to work on the spirit . 
As I mentioned last year , I grew up with no religion at all . 
I ' m Jewish , but I ' m Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian . 
( Laughter ) Not really . 
But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it . 
So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible . 
And from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard -- because Leviticus says you cannot shave . 
So this is what I looked like by the end . 
Thank you for that reaction . 
( Laughter ) I look a little like Moses , or Ted Kaczynski . 
I got both of them . 
So there was the topiary there . 
And there ' s the sheep . 
Now the final part of the trilogy was I wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person I could be , the healthiest person alive . 
So that ' s what I ' ve been doing the last couple of years . 
And I just finished a couple of months ago . 
And I have to say , thank God . 
Because living so healthily was killing me . 
( Laughter ) It was so overwhelming , because the amount of things you have to do , it ' s just mind-boggling . 
I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers . 
And they were telling me all the things I had to do . 
I had to eat right , exercise , meditate , pet dogs , because that lowers the blood pressure . 
I wrote the book on a treadmill , and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book . 
I had to put on sunscreen . 
This was no small feat , because if you listen to dermatologists , they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen . 
And you have to reapply it every two to four hours . 
So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen . 
I was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year . 
There was the washing of hands . 
I had to do that properly . 
And my immunologist told me that I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house , because those are just orgies of germs . 
So that took a lot of time . 
I also tried to be the safest person I could be , because that ' s a part of health . 
I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council .
